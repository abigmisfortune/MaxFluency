                <h2> The Communication Process </h2>
                <p>
                The communication process refers to the way of transmitting the message to the receiver. In this lesson we will be discussing the "elements of communication" in more detail and how they go hand-in-hand with one another.
                <br/> <br/>
                <b> Elements of Communication </b>
                <br/> <br/>
                <b> Sender </b> <br/>
                 The sender is where the initial message came from. A sender sends messages by both verbal and non-verbal means. He would send you a message and it could be a picture of a cat, a kind gesture, a morning greeting or even a simple stare. The sender will both voluntarily and involuntarily send out a message. 
                <br/> <br/>
                <b> Message </b> <br/>
                This is what is being sent to the receiver. As stated before, it comes both verbally and non-verbally. The message is the core component of communication. After all, communication is the act of sending and receiving messages.
                <br/> <br/>
                <b> Encoding </b> <br/>
                This is the act of inputting something into the proper medium or channel. This is the way of sending a message. Always take account where, when and how you send the message. Imagine you wanted to ask money from your mom. You did it when she wasn't in a good mood. In addition, you addressed her rudely. You're not getting your money anytime soon. 
                 <br/> <br/>
                <b> Channel </b> <br/>
                This is where your message is encoded. Choosing the proper channel is important. Think of it like coding. Where do we input the code to be executed? The code editor! Encoding is important, because inappropriate encoding may result in miscommunication. Imagine you put your code into Microsoft Word. The output is just plain text!
                <br/> <br/>
                <b> Receiver </b> <br/>
                The receiver receives the message. Take note, we can be both receiver and senders at the same time. Receivers will decode the sender's message and form their own response or feedback.
                <br/> <br/>
                <b> Decoding </b> <br/>
                When you input your code, the computer will be responsible in analyzing and interpreting it. It's the same with human communication. You send the message and the receiver will put two and two together to form an interpretation. 
                <br/> <br/>
                <b> Feedback </b> <br/>
                Of course, when you send you a message, there will always be a response. It's a message being sent back to the initial sender. The feedback is where you find out whether your message really went across or not. You could have explained how to solve for "x" for thirty minutes or so and get a blank stare. 
                <br/> <br/>
                <b>Interference in Communication Process</b> <br/>
                <b> Noise</b>
                This is an interence in the communication process. Noise can either be physical, psychological, semantic or physiological.
