<img src="unnamed.png"></center>
<p class="paragraph"> He is our friendly
Neighborhood pug that's out  to help us on our journey!
He is the mascot of our app due to a few reasons.</p>

<ol class="paragraph" id="reasons">
<li class="space"> It was hard to think of a perfect logo representing communication </li>
<li class="space"> Dogs are very expressive animals. They may not be able to talk, but they have
many ways to express how they feel </li>
<li class="space"> Pugs are cute! They have expressive eyes and they're kind of stubborn, but don't really get into much mischief.
Also, they're pretty polite</li>

<center><h1 class="title"> MaxFluency x Showerthoughts </h1></center>
<p class="paragraph"> MaxFluency x Showerthoughts is a partnership between the two 
development teams. Both teams have own quiz type apps. In exchange for aiding Showerthoughts
in coding their app, MaxFluency gets to have on tutorial video starring Rence Dela Cruz (from Showerthoughts)
as speaker. Anyway, please support both MaxFluency and Showerthoughts </p>
